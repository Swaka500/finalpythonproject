# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data visualization and analysis project that tracks the global impact of COVID-19. It provides insights into the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across different countries, using real-time data.

## Project Objectives

* Track global COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination statistics.
* Visualize trends and patterns using graphs and charts.
* Enable users to view data for specific countries and regions.
* Provide insights into how the pandemic has evolved over time.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python: Main programming language.
* Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: Numerical computations.
* Matplotlib: Data visualization.
* Plotly: Interactive plots.
* Requests: Data fetching from APIs.
* Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding and analysis.
